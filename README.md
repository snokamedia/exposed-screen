## Features
One of the features of this tool is its ability to deduce extended displays, estimating the height of the primary display if the window is on the bottom extended display and the width of the primary display if the window is on the right extended display. In addition, it can also predict the operating system being used (currently only Windows 10, 11, and macOS), and will attempt to detect if it is running on a virtual machine (commonly used by bots).

Try resizing your window, moving it to a different screen, zooming in or out, open dev tools, change the size of your taskbar/menu bar, and turn the bookmark bar on and off. Take a screenshot of it with a bot or online screenshot tool and see if it gets detected as a VM.
