## Key Features

The Web-exposed Screen Profiler visualizes web-exposed screen information to show you what your screen and browser window looks like to a website.

This also demonstrates how the visitorâ€™s OS can be deduced without using user-agent data and how extended displays can be derived without using the Multi-Screen Window Placement API. It can be a useful tool to help develop more comprehensive detection scripts that can infer more device details beyond user-agent data which can be easily spoofed and mimicked.

Try resizing your window, moving it to a different screen, zooming in or out, changing the size of your taskbar/menu bar, and turning your bookmark bar on and off. Take a screenshot of it with a bot or online screenshot tool and see if it gets detected as a VM.
